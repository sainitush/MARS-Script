MARS-Script
This indicator is called "Moving Average Relative Strength" (MARS) and is designed to analyze the performance of a stock relative to a chosen index. It provides a visual representation of the stock's performance compared to the index using a histogram or line plot. The key features of the MARS indicator are:

    Allows selection of the moving average type (SMA, EMA, or WMA) and length to calculate the relative strength

Provides options to plot the relative strength as a line, histogram, or columns
Enables comparison of the stock's performance to either the NIFTY, CNX500, NIFTYSMLCAP250, or CNXSMALLCAP index
Offers customization options such as painting bars, background color, easy colors, dark mode for the table, and zero line display
Includes a table that displays the type of outperformance or underperformance (relative, gross, or absolute) along with the RS rating and returns for various time periods (5d, 10d, 20d, 50d)
The indicator calculates the relative strength by comparing the stock's percentage change to the index's percentage change over the specified moving average length. The results are then plotted using the chosen style (line, histogram, or columns). Overall, the MARS indicator provides a comprehensive way to analyze a stock's performance relative to a chosen index, with customizable settings and a detailed table to aid in decision-making.
